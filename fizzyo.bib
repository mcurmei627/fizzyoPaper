@article{Ning2014,
abstract = {This paper jointly addresses the problems of chromatogram baseline correction and noise reduction. The proposed approach is based on modeling the series of chromatogram peaks as sparse with sparse derivatives, and on modeling the baseline as a low-pass signal. A convex optimization problem is formulated so as to encapsulate these non-parametric models. To account for the positivity of chromatogram peaks, an asymmetric penalty function is utilized. A robust, computationally efficient, iterative algorithm is developed that is guaranteed to converge to the unique optimal solution. The approach, termed Baseline Estimation and Denoising With Sparsity (BEADS), is evaluated and compared with two state-of-the-art methods using both simulated and real chromatogram data.},

@article{Eng2019,
abstract = {Background Joint inflammation is the common feature underlying juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Clinicians recognize patterns of joint involvement currently not part of the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification. Using unsupervised machine learning, we sought to uncover data-driven joint patterns that predict clinical phenotype and disease trajectories.   Methods and findings We analyzed prospectively collected clinical data, including joint involvement using a standard 71-joint homunculus, for 640 discovery patients with newly diagnosed JIA enrolled in a Canada-wide study who were followed serially for five years, treatment-na{\"{i}}ve except for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diagnosed within one year of symptom onset. Twenty-one patients had systemic arthritis, 300 oligoarthritis, 125 rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarthritis, 16 RF-positive polyarthritis, 37 psoriatic arthritis, 78 enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), and 63 undifferentiated arthritis. At diagnosis, we observed global hierarchical groups of co-involved joints. To characterize these patterns, we developed sparse multilayer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Model selection by internal bi-cross-validation identified seven joint patterns at presentation, to which all 640 discovery patients were assigned: pelvic girdle (57 patients), fingers (25), wrists (114), toes (48), ankles (106), knees (283), and indistinct (7). Patterns were distinct from clinical subtypes (P {\textless} 0.001 by $\chi$2 test) and reproducible through external data set validation on a 119-patient, prospectively collected independent validation cohort (reconstruction accuracy Q2 = 0.55 for patterns; 0.35 for groups). Some patients matched multiple patterns. To determine whether their disease outcomes differed, we further subdivided the 640 discovery patients into three subgroups by degree of localization—the percentage of their active joints aligning with their assigned pattern: localized (≥90{\%}; 359 patients), partially localized (60{\%}–90{\%}; 124), or extended ({\textless}60{\%}; 157). Localized patients more often maintained their baseline patterns (P {\textless} 0.05 for five groups by permutation test) than nonlocalized patients (P {\textless} 0.05 for three groups by permutation test) over a five-year follow-up period. We modelled time to zero joints in the discovery cohort using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model considering joint pattern, degree of localization, and ILAR subtype. Despite receiving more intense treatment, 50{\%} of nonlocalized patients had zero joints at one year compared to six months for localized patients. Overall, localized patients required less time to reach zero joints (partial: P = 0.0018 versus localized by log-rank test; extended: P = 0.0057). Potential limitations include the requirement for patients to be treatment na{\"{i}}ve (except NSAIDs), which may skew the patient cohorts towards milder disease, and the validation cohort size precluded multivariate analyses of disease trajectories.   Conclusions Multilayer NMF identified patterns of joint involvement that predicted disease trajectory in children with arthritis. Our hierarchical unsupervised approach identified a new clinical feature, degree of localization, which predicted outcomes in both cohorts. Detailed assessment of every joint is already part of every musculoskeletal exam for children with arthritis. Our study supports both the continued collection of detailed joint involvement and the inclusion of patterns and degrees of localization to stratify patients and inform treatment decisions. This will advance pediatric rheumatology from counting joints to realizing the potential of using data available from uncovering patterns of joint involvement.},

@article{Seymour2019,
abstract = {Importance Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may allow more precise therapy and improve care. Objective To derive sepsis phenotypes from clinical data, determine their reproducibility and correlation with host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and assess the potential causal relationship with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Design, Settings, and Participants Retrospective analysis of data sets using statistical, machine learning, and simulation tools. Phenotypes were derived among 20 189 total patients (16 552 unique patients) who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of hospital presentation at 12 Pennsylvania hospitals (2010-2012) using consensuskmeans clustering applied to 29 variables. Reproducibility and correlation with biological parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed in a second database (2013-2014; n = 43 086 total patients and n = 31 160 unique patients), in a prospective cohort study of sepsis due to pneumonia (n = 583), and in 3 sepsis RCTs (n = 4737). Exposures All clinical and laboratory variables in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures Derived phenotype ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$,and $\delta$) frequency, host-response biomarkers, 28-day and 365-day mortality, and RCT simulation outputs. Results The derivation cohort included 20 189 patients with sepsis (mean age, 64 [SD, 17] years; 10 022 [50{\%}] male; mean maximum 24-hour Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, 3.9 [SD, 2.4]). The validation cohort included 43 086 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 17] years; 21 993 [51{\%}] male; mean maximum 24-hour SOFA score, 3.6 [SD, 2.0]). Of the 4 derived phenotypes, the $\alpha$ phenotype was the most common (n = 6625; 33{\%}) and included patients with the lowest administration of a vasopressor; in the $\beta$ phenotype (n = 5512; 27{\%}), patients were older and had more chronic illness and renal dysfunction; in the $\gamma$ phenotype (n = 5385; 27{\%}), patients had more inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction; and in the $\delta$ phenotype (n = 2667; 13{\%}), patients had more liver dysfunction and septic shock. Phenotype distributions were similar in the validation cohort. There were consistent differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype. In the derivation cohort, cumulative 28-day mortality was 287 deaths of 5691 unique patients (5{\%}) for the $\alpha$ phenotype; 561 of 4420 (13{\%}) for the $\beta$ phenotype; 1031 of 4318 (24{\%}) for the $\gamma$ phenotype; and 897 of 2223 (40{\%}) for the $\delta$ phenotype. Across all cohorts and trials, 28-day and 365-day mortality were highest among the $\delta$ phenotype vs the other 3 phenotypes (P {\textless} .001). In simulation models, the proportion of RCTs reporting benefit, harm, or no effect changed considerably (eg, varying the phenotype frequencies within an RCT of early goal-directed therapy changed the results from {\textgreater}33{\%} chance of benefit to {\textgreater}60{\%} chance of harm). Conclusions and Relevance In this retrospective analysis of data sets from patients with sepsis, 4 clinical phenotypes were identified that correlated with host-response patterns and clinical outcomes, and simulations suggested these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity of treatment effects. Further research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical care and for informing trial design and interpretation.},

abstract={Accurate prediction of survival for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is instrumental in establishing the optimal timing for referring patients with terminal respiratory failure for lung transplantation (LT). Current practice considers referring patients for LT evaluation once the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) drops below 30\% of its predicted nominal value. While FEV1 is indeed a strong predictor of CF-related mortality, we hypothesized that the survival behavior of CF patients exhibits a lot more heterogeneity. To this end, we developed an algorithmic framework, which we call AutoPrognosis, that leverages the power of machine learning to automate the process of constructing clinical prognostic models, and used it to build a prognostic model for CF using data from a contemporary cohort that involved 99\% of the CF population in the UK. AutoPrognosis uses Bayesian optimization techniques to automate the process of configuring ensembles of machine learning pipelines, which involve imputation, feature processing, classification and calibration algorithms. Because it is automated, it can be used by clinical researchers to build prognostic models without the need for in-depth knowledge of machine learning. Our experiments revealed that the accuracy of the model learned by AutoPrognosis is superior to that of existing guidelines and other competing models.},

@article{Modi2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND
Adherence rates for chronic pediatric conditions are approximately 50{\%}. The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). 

METHODS
Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. 

RESULTS
Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50{\%} for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27{\%} to 46{\%}. 

CONCLUSIONS
The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors.},
